## Hi there

I wear many hats in my professional life - developer, system administrator, and even a teacher at times. You could say I have a mixed bag of skills and experiences, both good and bad. One thing I absolutely love is writing, so you'll find some of my content floating around the web, along with a ton of code.

Feel free to explore and dive into my world of tech adventures! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joebordes/joebordes/master/wave.gif" width="30px">
